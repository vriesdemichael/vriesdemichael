Hi, I’m @vriesdemichael

I currently work at the dutch tax office in a cool team which creates ML cloud applications using our on premise openshift cluster.

My interest are:
- ML software (especially the deep learning frameworks)
- Cloud operations
- Over the top finnicky container solutions
- Streamlining the remote containerized development workflow
- CICD optimization
- Non profit organizations

I'm open to work on open source projects that align with my interest ocasionally, but not willing to take a leading role.

Feel free to contact me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vriesdemichael/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3BpTLtzC8dShWYUT4%2FCZuImw%3D%3D)
